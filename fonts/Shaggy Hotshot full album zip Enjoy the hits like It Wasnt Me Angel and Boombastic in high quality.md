Shaggy is one of the most successful reggae-pop artists of all time, with hits like "It Wasn't Me", "Angel" and "Boombastic". His 2000 album *Hot Shot* was a global phenomenon, selling over six million copies and topping the charts in several countries. In 2020, Shaggy decided to re-record the album with new arrangements, guest features and some new songs, calling it *Hot Shot 2020*.
 
But does the updated version live up to the original? According to some critics, the answer is no. NME gave the album two stars out of five, saying that it was "just not as interesting, fun or even simply as weird as you imagine it could be" [^3^]. They also criticized Shaggy for "bringing nothing new to the table" and for relying on "tired tropes and clichÃ©s" [^3^]. They concluded that *Hot Shot 2020* was "a missed opportunity to reinvent himself and his legacy" [^3^].

However, not everyone was so harsh on Shaggy's remake. Some fans appreciated the nostalgia factor and the fresh twists on the classic songs. For example, one YouTube user commented on the playlist of *Hot Shot 2020*: "This album is amazing! Shaggy never disappoints. He brought back some old school vibes with a modern touch" [^2^]. Another user wrote: "I love this album! Shaggy is a legend and he did a great job with this remake. The new songs are awesome too" [^2^].
 
Ultimately, *Hot Shot 2020* is a tribute to Shaggy's enduring popularity and influence in the music industry. Whether you prefer the original or the remake, there is no denying that Shaggy is a hot shot in his own right.
