## What is the HP Pavilion G6 Windows 8 Recovery Disk?
 
The HP Pavilion G6 Windows 8 recovery disk is a downloadable file that contains the operating system, drivers, and software that came pre-installed on your laptop.

The recovery disk is not the same as a system image or a backup. A system image is a copy of your entire hard drive that can be used to restore your PC to the exact state it was in when the image was created. A backup is a copy of your personal files and settings that can be used to restore them in case of data loss. The recovery disk does not contain any of your personal files or settings, so you should always create a backup before using it.
