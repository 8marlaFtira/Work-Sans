## Plugin Hosting
  
Brainspawn Forte 4 can host up to 32 virtual instruments in a single rack file. You can load any VST plugin that is compatible with Windows and use it as an instrument or an effect. You can also create multiple instrument modules and assign them to different MIDI channels or inputs. You can then mix and route the audio outputs of each instrument module to one or more audio busses or outputs.
  
## Scene Management
  
A scene is a snapshot of the entire rack state, including plugin settings, MIDI routing, audio routing, and control surface assignments. You can create as many scenes as you want and recall them instantly with a single click or a MIDI command. You can also edit scenes on the fly and save them as new scenes or overwrite existing ones. Scenes are the core of Forte's live performance capabilities, allowing you to switch between different sounds and configurations seamlessly.
  
## Audio Effects
  
Brainspawn Forte 4 allows you to add audio effects to any audio input, instrument module, or audio bus. You can choose from a wide range of VST effects plugins and control their parameters with MIDI controllers or control surfaces. You can also use the brainspawn Audio Input plugin to process live audio input through effects with very low latency.
  
## Virtual Set List
  
The SceneView feature of Brainspawn Forte 4 lets you create and manage virtual set lists for your live performance. You can organize your scenes into songs and arrange them in any order you want. You can also display the set of upcoming songs and scenes in large font, multiple line scene descriptions for storing notes per scene, and custom background pictures per scene. This way, you can have all the information you need at a glance and never miss a cue.
