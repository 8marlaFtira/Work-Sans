TT SUbD 2.1.4 is a plugin for Sketchup that allows you to create smooth and organic shapes by subdividing quad-based meshes. It is optimized for quad-based workflows and parametric subdivision. You can easily adjust the level of detail and smoothness of your models with a simple slider or by using keyboard shortcuts.
 
TT SUbD 2.1.4 is compatible with Sketchup 2019-2020 and requires Sketchup 2016 or newer to run[^1^] [^2^]. It is highly recommended that you also install QuadFace Tools, another plugin by the same developer, to assist in creating quad-based meshes that subdivide well with TT SUbD[^3^]. QuadFace Tools allows you to work with quads that are not coplanar, which is essential for creating organic and curved surfaces.

With TT SUbD 2.1.4, you can create stunning models that look like they were sculpted by hand, but with the precision and control of Sketchup. You can use it for various applications, such as character design, furniture design, product design, architecture, and more. TT SUbD 2.1.4 is a must-have plugin for anyone who wants to take their Sketchup modeling skills to the next level.
  
## How to Use TT SUbD 2.1.4 for Subdivision Modeling in Sketchup
 
To use TT SUbD 2.1.4 for subdivision modeling in Sketchup, you need to follow some basic steps:
 
1. Create a quad-based mesh using Sketchup's native tools or QuadFace Tools. Make sure your mesh is clean and has no holes, gaps, or overlapping faces.
2. Select the mesh and activate TT SUbD from the Extensions menu or the toolbar icon. You will see a preview of the subdivided mesh with a slider to adjust the level of subdivision.
3. Use the slider or the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + Up/Down) to increase or decrease the level of subdivision. You can also use the Crease tool to sharpen or smooth certain edges or vertices.
4. When you are happy with the result, you can either apply the subdivision permanently or keep it as a dynamic component that you can edit later.

TT SUbD 2.1.4 also has some advanced features, such as adaptive subdivision, quad matcap display, and custom keyboard shortcuts. You can access these features from the TT SUbD settings dialog.
 
## Benefits of Subdivision Modeling with TT SUbD 2.1.4
 
Subdivision modeling with TT SUbD 2.1.4 has many benefits, such as:

- It allows you to create smooth and organic shapes that are hard to achieve with Sketchup's native tools.
- It preserves the quad-based structure of your mesh, which makes it easier to edit, texture, and animate.
- It gives you more control and flexibility over the level of detail and smoothness of your models.
- It improves your workflow and productivity by reducing the number of polygons and simplifying your geometry.
