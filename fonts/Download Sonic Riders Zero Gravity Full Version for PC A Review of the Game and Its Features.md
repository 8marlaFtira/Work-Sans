- Learn how to use the gravity control system. This is a new feature in this game that allows you to manipulate gravity and perform amazing stunts. You can activate the gravity control by pressing the R1 button on your controller or the Shift key on your keyboard. You can then use the left analog stick or the arrow keys to steer your character in any direction. You can also use the gravity control to create shortcuts, avoid obstacles, and attack your opponents.
- Experiment with different characters and gear. Each character has their own stats and skills that affect their performance in the game. For example, Sonic is fast and agile, but has low defense and gravity points. Knuckles is strong and durable, but has low speed and acceleration. You can also choose from different types of gear, such as boards, bikes, or skates, that have different attributes and abilities. For example, boards are balanced and versatile, but have low handling and stability. Bikes are powerful and stable, but have low speed and maneuverability. Skates are fast and agile, but have low defense and durability.
- Collect rings and items. Rings are the currency of the game that you can use to buy new gear and items from the shop. You can also use rings to boost your speed and gravity points during a race. Items are power-ups that you can find on the track or get from item boxes. They can give you various advantages, such as speed boosts, shields, traps, or attacks. You can use items by pressing the L1 button on your controller or the Ctrl key on your keyboard.
- Complete missions and challenges. Besides the Story Mode and the Free Race Mode, you can also try other modes that offer different objectives and rewards. For example, in Mission Mode, you have to complete various tasks such as collecting rings, beating a certain time, or defeating a boss. In Survival Mode, you have to race against other players online or offline and try to stay alive as long as possible.
