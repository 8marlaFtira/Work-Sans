Now that you have installed the driver, you can start using your mp9 pen camera to record video and audio. Here are some tips to help you use the device effectively:

- Make sure your mp9 pen camera is fully charged before using it. You can charge it by connecting it to your computer or a USB charger. The LED light on the pen will turn red when charging and green when fully charged.
- Insert a micro SD card into the slot on the pen. The device supports up to 32 GB of storage. Format the card before using it for the first time.
- To turn on the device, press and hold the button on the top of the pen for 3 seconds. The LED light will blink blue once and then turn off. This means the device is in standby mode.
- To start recording video and audio, press the button once briefly. The LED light will blink blue twice and then turn off. This means the device is recording.
- To stop recording, press the button once briefly again. The LED light will blink blue three times and then turn off. This means the device has saved the file and is back to standby mode.
- To turn off the device, press and hold the button for 3 seconds. The LED light will blink red once and then turn off. This means the device is powered off.
- To switch between video and photo mode, press and hold the button for 5 seconds while in standby mode. The LED light will blink blue four times and then turn off. This means the device has switched modes. You can switch back by repeating this step.
- To take a photo, press the button once briefly while in photo mode. The LED light will blink blue once and then turn off. This means the device has taken a photo and saved it.

Note: The LED light is only visible when you look at the pen from behind. It is not visible from the front or sides, so you can use the device discreetly.
